A curated collection of classification projects built with Python and PyTorch. The projects include both **image classification**.

The goal of this repository is to explore a wide range of supervised learning problems with a focus on technical accuracy, reproducibility, and clean code practices.


## 📌 What I Do in Each Project

In every classification project, the following steps are typically included:

- ✅ **Data loading and preprocessing**
- 🧠 **Model design and implementation** using PyTorch
- 🏋️ **Model training** with validation loop
- 📈 **Visualization of learning rate, loss curves, and accuracy curves**
- 📊 **Evaluation using key metrics**:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall (Sensitivity)
  - F1-Score
  - Confusion Matrix
- 🔍 **Visualization of misclassified samples**, especially for image-based tasks
- 💾 Optionally saving trained models and weights

## 📁 Structure

Each project is organized into its own folder and contains:
- Source code with documentation
- A `README.md` with specific details
- Scripts for training, evaluation, and visualization
- Dataset or download instructions
- Result visualizations (plots, confusion matrix, sample outputs)

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/karimpanah/classification_Satellite.git
cd classification_Satellite

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt


# Run a specific project
cd project1_satellite
python train.py


## 📦 General Requirements

Most projects rely on the following libraries:

- Python 3.8+
- PyTorch (latest stable)
- Torchvision (for image tasks)
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy, Pandas
- Matplotlib or Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook (for exploratory analysis)

To install basic dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt



📌 I actively update this repository with more experiments and datasets.

## 🧪 Technologies Used
